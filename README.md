Data Bootcamp Week Nineteen Unsupervised Learning

For this project, I clustered cryptocurrency data using K-Means to see how different price changes over time affect the groups. First, I scaled the data and used PCA to reduce the number of features. Then, I applied K-Means and compared the clustering results with and without PCA. I made Elbow curves to find the best number of clusters for both methods, and created scatter plots to visualize the clusters. This helped show how using fewer features with PCA can simplify the model, but might also make the clusters less distinct.
